Java Features Used :
1)Inheritance
Inheritance in java is a process of acquiring the properties i.e states and behavior of one class in another class.  In simple words, we can say one class accessing the states and behavior of another class is nothing but the inheritance. Here inheritance is used in inheriting jframe

2)Interface
Interfaces helps to achieve abstraction as it contains method declarations only, no method body. Using interfaces we can achieve multiple inheritance in java, as a class can implement multiple interfaces. Here interface is used for frame uses action listener 

3)Exception handling
In Java, an exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program. It is an object which is thrown at runtime. Here it is used in jdbc connectivity

4)Packages
Java package is used to categorize the classes and interfaces so that they can be easily maintained. Java package provides access protection. Java package removes naming collision. Here it is used to link all files

5)Swings
Java Swing is a part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC) that is used to create window-based applications. It is built on the top of AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit) API and entirely written in java. Here it is used for user interface design 

6)Awt
Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) is an API to develop Graphical User Interface (GUI) or windows-based applications in Java. Here it is used for user interface color and design.
7)Overriding
Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of a method which is already provided by its superclass. Here it is used for overriding action performed method

JDBC Connectivity Procedure :
